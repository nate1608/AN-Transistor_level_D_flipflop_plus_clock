# Transistor-Level D Flip-Flop with Integrated Clock Generator

This repository documents the design, simulation, and hardware implementation of an edge-triggered D flip-flop built from discrete transistors, along with a custom-built astable multivibrator clock circuit using an operational amplifier.

### üîç Project Overview

The primary goal of this project was to demonstrate a fundamental understanding of digital logic and analog electronics by building a sequential logic element‚Äîthe D flip-flop‚Äîfrom the ground up using basic components. The project involved designing the flip-flop circuit, creating a stable clock source, simulating the behavior, and validating the final hardware implementation on a breadboard.

### üéØ Key Objectives

-   **Design an Optimized D Flip-Flop:** Move beyond a gate-based implementation to create a more efficient D flip-flop using a minimal number of BJT transistors.
-   **Engineer a Stable Clock Source:** Build a 1 kHz astable multivibrator to provide a reliable clock signal for the flip-flop.
-   **Simulate and Validate:** Use LTspice to simulate the circuit's behavior and then verify the hardware prototype's functionality with an oscilloscope.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Circuit Design and Schematics

The final circuit consists of two main stages: the D flip-flop and the clock generator.

#### 1. D Flip-Flop (3-BJT Design)
Instead of a complex design requiring 10-11 transistors for individual logic gates, an optimized architecture based on an SR latch was implemented using only **three BC547B (NPN) BJT transistors**. This design minimizes component count and potential sources of error.

#### 2. Astable Multivibrator (Op-Amp Clock)
An astable multivibrator was engineered using an **LM741 Op-Amp** to generate a stable **1 kHz square wave**. This design was chosen after an initial BJT-based multivibrator produced a clock signal with insufficient amplitude and poor frequency stability. The Op-Amp version provided a reliable and clean clock signal.

### üî¨ Results & Validation

The integrated circuit was successfully built and tested on a breadboard. The functionality was validated using an oscilloscope, which confirmed that the D flip-flop correctly captured the data input (`Vin`) on the rising edge of the 1 kHz clock signal and held it until the next clock pulse.

#### Output Waveform
The oscilloscope readings showed the expected behavior: the output (`Vout(Purple)`) follows the input (`Vin`) (which is square wave having 2khz frequency with 70% Duty cycle for clear demonstration), the change happens only at Positive edege of the (`clock(Purple)`).
